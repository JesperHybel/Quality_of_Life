# Quality of Life

What makes life worth living? Life is very much about making the right location choices. Being in the right place at the right time is often critical and while most people are blessed with not having to make locational choices motivated by concerns of security, people still face life shaping trade offs, when deciding where to live and where to work. Where ever people decide to go they are frequently engaged in consumption of goods that for all practical purposes could be produced at any location and this consumption is financed by wage income. People therefore value access to jobs and in particular high paying jobs. High paying jobs are however not evenly distributed across the urban landscape as illustrated on the map below, displaying how high wage jobs in Denmark are concentrated around Copenhagen the capital of Denmark. The search for high paying jobs therefore attract people to the major cities as vibrant labour markets supported by the existence of relatively more efficient firms capable of paying the higher wages.

To avoid transportation cost people therefore prefer to locate in or around cities increasing the demand for housing in these areas. Funneling the savings in terms of avoided transportation costs into demand for housing in cities push up rents.
