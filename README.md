# Quality of Life

What makes life worth living? Life is very much about making the right location choices. Being in the right place at the right time is often critical and while most people are blessed with not having to make locational choices motivated by concerns of security, people still face life shaping trade offs, when deciding where to live and where to work. Where ever people decide to go they are frequently engaged in consumption of goods that for all practical purposes could be produced at any location and this consumption is financed by wage income. People therefore value access to jobs and in particular high paying jobs. High paying jobs are however not evenly distributed across the urban landscape as illustrated on the map below, displaying how high wage jobs in Denmark are concentrated around Copenhagen the capital of Denmark. The search for high paying jobs therefore attract people to the major cities as vibrant labour markets supported by the existence of relatively more efficient firms capable of paying the higher wages in these cities.

To avoid transportation cost people therefore prefer to locate in or around cities increasing the demand for housing in these areas. Funneling the savings in terms of avoided transportation costs into demand for housing in cities which partly make cities grow and partly push up rents. This is illustrated on the map below where it can be observed that just as wages are high in the area around the capital so are housing prices.

The gain people have in terms of higher wages are therefore not simply channeled into higher levels of consumption but are instead eroded by the higher cost of living that cities offer mainly due to their higher rents. To avoid this trap transportation is key, making it possible for people to live in one place at lower cost of living while working in another place gaining the benefits of higher wages. The third map illustrates the connectness of the areas of Denmark in terms of how costly transportation to and from work are on average for people living in the area given their choices of job location. The map clearly shows how some places are relatively remote with very high transportation costs both due to natural hinandrances as in the case of some of the island municipalities but also simply due to the large distance to the major cities where most people work.
