# Quality of Life

What makes life worth living? Life is very much about making the right location choices. Being in the right place at the right time is often critical and while most people are blessed with not having to make locational choices motivated by concerns of security, people still face life shaping trade offs, when deciding where to live and where to work. Where ever people decide to go they are frequently engaged in consumption of goods that for all practical purposes could be produced at any location and this consumption is financed by wage income. People therefore value access to jobs and in particular high paying jobs. High paying jobs are however not evenly distributed across the urban landscape as illustrated on the map below, displaying how high wage jobs in Denmark are concentrated around Copenhagen the capital of Denmark. The search for high paying jobs therefore attract people to the major cities as vibrant labour markets supported by the existence of relatively more efficient firms capable of paying the higher wages in these cities.

To avoid transportation costs people therefore prefer to locate in or around cities increasing the demand for housing in these areas. Funneling the savings in terms of avoided transportation costs into demand for housing in cities which partly make cities grow and partly push up rents. This is illustrated on the map below where it can be observed that just as wages are high in the area around the capital so are housing prices.

The gain people have in terms of higher wages are therefore not simply channeled into higher levels of consumption but are instead eroded by the higher cost of living that cities offer mainly due to their higher rents. To avoid this trap transportation is key, making it possible for people to live in one place at lower cost of living while working in another place gaining the benefits of higher wages. The third map illustrates the connectedness of the areas of Denmark in terms of how costly transportation to and from work are on average for people living in the area given their choices of job location. The map clearly shows how some places are relatively remote with very high transportation costs both due to natural hinandrances as in the case of some of the island municipalities but also simply due to the large distance to the major cities where most people work.

This offcourse raise the question who is the most clever? Is it the person who suffer the high rents of cities but enjoy the high wages and short distance to work, is it the person who enjoy low housing price of the country side suffering the long daily commute to high paying job in the city or is it rather the person who live in the country side and enjoys low housing prices and while simultaneously enjoying a short commute having chosen also to work in the country side even though this means suffering a relatively low wage? 

Economist in general credit people with the capability of making sane choices. Hence if people really are free to live and work where they prefer and all people are similar to the extent of enjoying some consumption while disliking transportation, this puts a limit on how much better one place can be in relation to another. A city that offers both high wages and low rents will quicly see itself subject to growth pushing up the housing prices. Desolate places becomes attractive as places of transportation investments connecting previously remote areas with already developed areas making a daily commute possible. However in equilibrium where the forces of attraction - high wages luring people towards the cities - are balanced by the powers of dispersion - the high rents pushing people out of cities all all people must be more or less content with living and working at the locations they have chosen. This suggests that we can add up the opportunities of a location in terms of access to labor market as given by the wage level of peoples choice of job location, the transportation costs derived from location of residence and work and finally the costs of local goods in terms primarily of rents. And in equilibrium the sum of these things for any location add up evenly if noone is to be assumed to have made a less sane choice.

To the extent that these things do not add up something unobserved could then be hypothesized to exist in order to somehow balance the equation. This something could be referred to as the livability of the location which is very much determined by the aminities the location has to offer. The map below show locations characterized by the extent to which people are willing to make sacrifices in terms of disbalance of transportions costs, housing prices and wages in order to enjoys the amenities offered by the location. Basically it tells how the high housing prices of places such as Århus, Fanø and Copenhagen area are insufficiently compensated for by lower transportation and higher wages.

Still if people who live there are not to be assumed stupid these areas must for some reason offer a higher level of livability in terms of better schools, nice beach areas, a larger variety of consumer goods to name just some of the aminities determining the livability of a city.
